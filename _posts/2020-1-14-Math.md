3 different correlations:

Pearson rho: most well known correlation
Correlation is a good measure when variables are distributed as multivariate elliptical.
An elliptical distribution is any member of a broad family of probability distributions that generalize the multivariate normal distribution
Disadvantage: 1. Cannot measure non linear relations 2. It is only the natural dependence measure when two variables jointly are normal/t distributed. 3. Sensitive to outliers

Spearman rho: 
Method: 
1. Change the raw value to their rank, 2. Compute the rank differences squared 3. Compute summation of rank differences squared, say x 4. Spearman rho is 6x/(n(n-1)(n+1))

Kendallâ€™s tau:
Method: 
1.	Change the raw value to their rank
2.	Count the number of concordant pairs and discordant pairs. This means that for n pairs of data, which has n pairs of ranks. We have n choose 2 combinations of pairs. Then we see whether rank a> rank b in both pair or they have rank a >rank b in one pair but opposite in another pair. If same rank we have neither concordant pair nor discordant pair
3.	(# of concordant - # of discordant)/ (n choose 2)
